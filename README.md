# Pick-and-Place-Manipulator-Robot
In this project, you will remotely access the manipulator in Figure 1 and program it in MATLAB to achieve a pick-and-place sequence of motions. The entire arm is driven by three motors (See Figure 3): • Motor A • Motor B • Motor C In addition to the three actuators, the system has five sensors: • Touch sensor #1 (See Figure 2) • Touch sensor #2 (See Figure 2) • Motor A encoder • Motor B encoder • Motor C encoder
